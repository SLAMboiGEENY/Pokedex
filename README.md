My PokeDex and how it was created.

## Table of Contents
* 1.) what frameworks were used?

## Getting started
So a ton of things were on my mind as far as what should my next project be, what frameworks to use, etc etc etc...

However after plenty of research and overall procrastination I decided upon NextJS and to learn how to use SSR/SSG rendering.
